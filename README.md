# Audio Visualization Project

This repository offers an interactive audio visualization experience by capturing sound in real-time through the user's device microphone. Inspired by the structure of Bruno Simon's "Three.js Journey" for organizing large projects, it integrates custom shaders to create unique visual effects on an included 3D model. To get started, a specific 3D model must be placed in the designated folder. Contact me for a demo!
